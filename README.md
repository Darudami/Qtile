# Qtile

Trying out qtile and working on my own config file.  Mostly I'm hunting through other configs for something neat and adding it to mine.  Learning Python in the meantime.  Currently running on vanilla Arch.

## Currently used programs
* Firefox
* Thunar file manager
* Terminator
* Nitrogen
* Picom

### History
10/26/21
Working on some extra icons and widgets.  Added the network icon and starting it at boot.
Also added the battery icon and modified the clock so it doesn't take that much space.
